This is my first repo for the ExpenseAPP project and I am working on.

It has 3 RHEL9 Servers
  1) Fron END server which is having Nginx install
  2) MySQL DB Server where It has mysql version
  3) Backend server where my app code and DB scripts, DB client and NodeJS install.

Also we need to configure the IPs on Backend server of DB server
and on Frontend server of backend server
Once this is all done you should be able to add the data on Expense App server.
